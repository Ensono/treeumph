### Formatting / Linting:
The project uses [rome.tools](https://rome.tools/) to format and lint the code. To run the formatter and linter, run `npm run lint`.
It is also recommended to install the [rome-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=romefrontend.rome-vscode) extension to get realtime feedback on your code.
